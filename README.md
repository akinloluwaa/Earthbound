# Earthbound - Website


## Project Overview
This project is a static webpage for "Earthbound," an initiative focused on solar energy and carbon offsetting projects in Africa. The website provides information about Earthbound's mission, ongoing projects, impact in numbers, and ways for users to get involved or request a quote.

The design emphasizes clean, professional aesthetics while focusing on user engagement, promoting calls to action like "Request a free quote" and "Start Saving."

## Design Choices
1. Minimalistic, Professional Aesthetic
The design uses a clean layout with ample white space to provide a professional feel. The visual hierarchy is established through the use of large, bold headings, engaging imagery, and a logical flow from section to section. The color scheme complements the environmental and renewable energy focus of Earthbound.

2. Responsive Design
The meta tag with viewport settings ensures responsiveness across devices by adjusting the layout for different screen sizes.
Bootstrap’s grid system has been partially integrated to facilitate responsiveness for smaller screens.
A hamburger menu is included for navigation on mobile devices.
3. Typography
Google Fonts' News Cycle is selected for a modern, clean, and easy-to-read typeface. It enhances the professional tone while ensuring readability on various screen sizes.
4. Call to Action (CTA) Focus
Buttons such as "Request a free quote" and "Start Saving" are prominently displayed to guide users toward key interactions.
Bright, contrasting button colors are used to draw user attention, enhancing conversion opportunities.
5. Branding and Logos
Partner logos are showcased to emphasize trustworthiness and credibility. These images support Earthbound's brand image and provide social proof.
6. Sustainability and Impact Messaging
Sections like "Our Impact in Numbers" and "Offset Your Carbon Footprint" highlight the tangible benefits Earthbound delivers, reinforcing the company’s purpose.

## Assumptions Made
Assets Folder Structure

1. It is assumed that all images are placed under an ./Assets/ directory. If this folder is structured differently, images might not load correctly. Ensure the assets are in the right location as defined by the src attributes in the img tags.
Dynamic Content

2. The website is currently a static HTML page. If dynamic content (e.g., live project data, user authentication) is required, it would need additional backend support.
Cross-browser Compatibility

3. The website assumes modern browsers and may require polyfills for older browsers. No special support has been added for legacy browsers like Internet Explorer.

## Running the Page Locally
1. Clone or download the project from the repository.
2. Make sure all files (HTML, CSS, assets) are in the same directory structure as referenced in the code (e.g., images in ./Assets/).
3. Open the index.html file in your browser.
